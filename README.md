# sign-language-transcriber

This project enables real-time **hand sign detection and conversion into text** using a machine learning model trained on hand landmarks captured via MediaPipe.

## Overview

- Detects hand gestures (A-Z, SPACE, BACKSPACE)
- Normalizes hand positions for consistent predictions
- Requires holding a gesture steadily to confirm input
- Displays real-time predictions and builds a live text stream

##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-sign-to-text.git
cd hand-sign-to-text
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the App
```bash
python app.py
```

> Press `q` to quit the live video stream.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Uses **MediaPipe Hands** to detect 21 landmarks
2. Normalizes landmarks relative to the wrist (to ignore hand position)
3. Feeds the normalized vector to a trained `model_03.pkl`
4. Uses a timer to confirm gesture stability before accepting input
5. Displays predictions and builds the final output text

### Special Gestures
- `SPACE` → Adds space to the text
- `BACKSPACE` → Removes the last character

## 🧠 Model Training (Optional)
If you want to train your own model using `hand_signs2.csv`:
- Each row should contain 63 landmark features and a label (A-Z, SPACE, BACKSPACE)
- Use any classifier (e.g., RandomForest, Optuna-optimized models)
